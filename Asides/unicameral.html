<fieldset><legend>UNICAMERAL explained</legend>
Unicameral legislatures exist when there is no widely perceived need for multicameralism. Multicameral legislatures provide space for voices of the  different sectors of society. An  advantage of a unicameral system is (more) efficient lawmaking as the legislative process is simpler with no possibility of deadlock. 

Unicameralism can  reduce costs even when the number of legislators stay the same since there are fewer institutions to maintain and support. However bicameral legislatures do offer opportunity for debate and correction of errors in either chamber in parallel, and in some cases allow for introduction of  legislation in either chamber. Bicameral legislatures often make provision for experts to participate in lawmaking without being professional politicians.

The main weakness of a unicameral system can be seen as the lack of restraint on the majority, particularly noticeable in parliamentary systems where the leaders of the parliamentary majority also dominate the executive. There is also the risk that important sectors of society may not be adequately represented.</fieldset>
