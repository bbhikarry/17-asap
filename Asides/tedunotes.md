My takehome. Trinidad and Tobago needs a resetting of the psyche so that people reevaluate the laisez faire (according to Dennise) Mariano citing the Japan and Korean example thinks a more fundamental approach is required. start small and grow from there. Big ideas like ICT will fail if the attitudes are shaky.
