<p>The United Nations Economic Commission to Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) recently put out a paper reflecting their insight into transformative recovery that also encompasses equality and sustainability. As one overview of what will be a massive economic paradigm shift it is an entralling read. It also supports an unsurprising assumption; that developed countries will survive even thrive after a relatively short period of adjustment but smaller nations including island states will suffer indefinitely.</p>
<p>The purpose of the discussion which follows though is not to review <a href="https://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/46228/4/S2000698_en.pdf">the UN-ECLAC’s document</a> but to accept what they are saying given their vantage point. We want to do this to be able to identify adjustments that are doable in a future that is uncertain. Saying that this writer apologises in advance in case any material referred to in the UN-ECLAC work is portrayed differently to what was intended. For that, if it occurs, creative license applies as it will to any work of fiction.</p>
<p>ECLAC’s take is the Caribbean is a peripheral. That is it is ‘away’ from the developed hubs of technology, industry and modern thinking<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and therefore must arrive at a state of equality before it can utilise systems that will be put to work in a post COVID world. This we gather, may be expensive. Even outside their reach given the constraints of limited landmass, logistical support and critically and importantly, the burden of having ‘own’ currencies. To expand on this last constraint: Small countries (<em>hence correspondingly tiny GDP’s</em>) with own currencies usually face adverse exchange rates in the marketplace which by virtue of necessity they must subscribe to for the goods they cannot make, the services they cannot perform.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get social</strong>. According to ECLAC thinking there are three issues keeping island states from achieving true sustainability. If that is we want to adhere to the post WW2 model; Prosperity for all. The issues ECLAC refers to may be likened to spaces. Each requiring a series of actions before the communities within those spaces can be mobilised to sustainable economic recovery after the pandemic. The Economic Commission makes the point however that a social gap exists; between the growth rate required for the region to achieve equality and the demand for what (we) do so it remains consistent with external equilibrium<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. The layman might be forgiven for thinking that here lies an opportunity for the Caribbean States to polish up on welfare governance across the board and using a formalised approach instead of goverment by electioneering.</p>
<p><strong>We want to watch that growth</strong> ECLAC’s second issue speaks to a gap between the growth consistent consistent with equilibrium and growth that is compatible with tipping back global Climate’s tipping point<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The question arises then. Should the Caribbean countries achieve equality with the ‘centres’ can it maintain balance between its natural systems and the need to provide jobs homes and other built development? Doing it in a manner consistent with modern life as occurs in the ‘centres’? Moreso all of this needs to be done in sync and with haste or problems like ‘brain-drain’ will force ‘the peripherals’ into cottage class or non-skilled non-specialised(meaning low paying) work.</p>
<p><strong>Where are we in relation to the SDG Agenda and the environment</strong>? The third issue spotlighted by ECLAC is a bit of a mind bender but highlights the too easily missed gap between the rate of growth required for equality and the growth rate compatible with the stability of the natural environment <!-- and which is the sum of the social gap and the environmental gap.-->Translated, we in the Caribbean should think of this as making haste to meet the norms of the developed world but trying not loss the assets/charms/benefits of the region.</p>
<p>There is something else to consider, call it the Caribbean deficit. With such large scale and pervasive change in the offing corruption will no doubt find fertile ground, given the weak, archaic and ponderous legislative environment of the region. The first casualty would seem to be the CARICOM accord which has ever been the proverbial tiger without teeth. But if we are seriously seeking to compete with the developed ‘centres’ the power of Caribbean community has to make a statement, which is a functional common market to begin with. CARICOM’s legacy one dares to say, may best be writ with presence, shall gain valuable ground with facilitating partnering in the region but its swan song, sustainable development of the region does not yet seem to be a focus. Is there anything else that can assist a sustainable Caribbean Recovery? <a href="https://www.cepal.org/en/escazuagreement">The Escazu<span class="math inline">′</span> Agreement</a> if ratified could well become the usher of the era in that the aforementioned ‘corruption deficit’ stands to be mitigated. But enough already.</p>
<p>We close off the sustainable sign-posting with a strong suggestion. One; Believers in the power of partnership (for the Goals) should read the ECLAC’s publication <a href="https://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/46228/4/S2000698_en.pdf">Building a New Future:Transformative Recovery with Equality and Sustainability</a> Two; Readers and fans might want to check back here in a few days. I’ll have the busmans view on tourism as an - scratch that, as the only economic gateway for small Caribbean island states. And remember. If you’re thinking to rebuild your business stronger, bigger, better think sustainability. And if you’re thinking we are too small to be a contender with the ‘centres’ you right, sort of. Because; the Caribbean remains unique and therefore marketable. The Caribbean is tiny in parts but the sum of its offering remains significant. To make it and keep it going though requires some smarts, especially in the competitive era of Recovery.</p>
