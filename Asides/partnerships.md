# Partnerships for recovery

<!--  for 17asap.net -->

Call it pandemic fallout but we are witnesses to a time when countries may not survive. Which makes it passing strange that CARICOM given its mandate is not looking set to seize this moment, to secure our region, to make the Caribbean a world player. The doomsday scenario has its adherents. As recently as the late September the Inter-American Development Bank circulated a report suggesting the Caribbean may be among the world's hardest hit regions. This in context of near term wealth generation and social discomfort over medium to long term. Much of this the IDB said, devolves to cost incurred around COVID 19 responses, along with the monetary impact wrought by Climate Change; taken to mean spending to repair infrastructure and build resiliency as well. The IDB report did not make mainstream news. Much of what the Bank does do not get major airplay unless its funding for highways, ports or big ticket items that 'benefit' borrowing populations. 

The conversation then is not whether the Caribbean is ready to provide its own impetus for development, though this should be part of CARICOM's priorities lest we forget the baby in trying to get the bathwater. Lay people should not depend on organisations like banks or big time NGOs to tell us what we have learnt so long ago. That bigger is better when talking trade (bloc) or simply presenting for grant funding from the multilaterals.      

The fact of the matter is the Caribbean is big. Equally its a diverse and valuable region blessed by beaches, warm water, sun and relatively friendly populations. Potentially then it has strong potential to demand fair treatment from its stakeholders in tourism, oil and gas, shipping and not least international airlift. Yet such equity has not been forthcoming if we look at the demands for allowances made for example, by certain trans-Atlantic carriers, before the coronavirus forced widespread border closures.    

Indeed Virgin was once quite the uncompromising partner in Caribbean tourism, so too TUI and even British Airways are guilty of putting the screws on us to make sure their balances stayed true to form. But fact being what it is nothing that was in place before the Lockdown needs to be reinstated without due consideration and rigorous evaluation. Enter CARICOM's big moment if the members states can come to realise this before any more time passes.

What can a united and functional CARICOM achieve?
