So I made a new text file using notepad from the Git CMD like so;

	start notepad examplefile.txt

and then i typed this into it. Why? cos I need to see if I can use the prompt to interact with GitHub from C:\Users\novas\GIT17ASAP

And it worked. However I'm having a little issue  Made mistake by setting up the GitHb repo inside a repo. So now I want to use the Git CMD prompt to mange everything  - thats the 2 folders. Hence this test. 

I literally am going to send 2 files from the local machine to the remote repo and they will be files of the same name but diff content

and this is a test of using a github branch inside the master.
