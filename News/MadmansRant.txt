## Ideas from another world ##
**critically assessing the social media's influence and content**

If we can't find solutions to creating sustainable development, growth and also a more green perspective and world view then what is the point of humanity wasting time with discussions and public relations? 

In order for public to really grasp information, it must be put over in a palatable and digestible format right? Ok fine.... I am appreciative of these factors, however, why is it everything is seemingly shorter and less valuable in terms of content? 
Dare I say it's as though technology has helped us as much as it is creating a generation of depenency on passing fads and content based on whimsical thoughts. 

Where are the lasting ideas that continue and cement themselves into discussions globally? Seems like the only thing that can continuously be discussed is a disease or pandemic. Something as destructive as an influenza or infections disease such as COVID19 remains relavant. 

That raises serious questions in my mind to the effectiveness of our social media craze. Just as the man on the moon craze, a buzz is created, but does the buzz last? 
I have many questions. They may never be answered but at least I can aggitate for people to think. The mind is a terrible thing to waste no? Are we wasting the mind because of short texts and less content? Are we wasting our mind with 30 second adverts? The visuals are awesome and the audio may seem stimulating and otherwordly, but where is the value for money in terms of content? 

I often wonder how life was when the internet was in a cup. The coffee shops in europe seemed to be the 'in thing' or the sidewalk cafe's that had blended offerings to tickle the tastebuds and give much needed voices to traders, messengers, teachers, even the odd judge or two and politicians at times. 

A mental revolution didnt begin with a 50 word post on a social media platform, it began with a man having a glorious high from his own mental framework and a cup of coffee. It began with a woman that had dreams of voting, or a labourer having dreams of spearheading an effort to unionize all public sector institutions. 

Ideas were verbilized and created with a view of giving an audience to people who needed or thought they needed to be heard. 
Does social media give you a voice? This virtual world that we love and embrace as is (especially since we don't want to become unclean like the lepper that jesus had to heal) or the fear of becoming diseased and ending up ceasing to exist in this 'beautiful world', does it help us to forumate ideas that reduce carbon footprint?
Or do we just run aimlessly like chickens without a head to find the next big craze or fad? 

I wonder....

I ponder...

I feel therefore I am...

A madman's rant it seems...
