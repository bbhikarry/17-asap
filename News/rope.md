## Unsustainability on the ropes

On the first day of the second re-opening of the beaches Environment Tobago participated in an example of Partnerships for Sustainability at the beautiful and famous Mt Irvine Bay. Admittedly it was the humblest of efforts - re-purposed rope, some concrete blocks for anchors and 'rescued' PET containers for floats. Speaking for the NGOs and the individuals who took time to be there on the day, the community if you will all said it was a distinct pleasure be part of the marking action. 

**What was the problem and how was it addressed by this action**? The area is prone to overfishing; to improper anchoring by pleasure boats. Swimmers and other beach lovers are ever at risk from over-enthusiastic jetski drivers and the sometimes really busy fishing pirogues. The chosen remedy, a 100 metre floating rope is intended to 'show' the spearfishers and the beach seine man Alfie and the busy pirogues that Mt Irvine is a multi-faceted marine space, a delicate space. Will it work? Probably - if the value of the locale can be ascertained.

**Mt Irvine Bay** is a unique geography. Located on the western coast it escapes the constant battering of the waves driven by the North East Trades - having to deal only with wintertime swells caused by cold fronts coming out of the North American Mainland. As a result it has accumulated over time a healthy sand layer nearer shore, over its rocky bottom. Three or four hundred meters out though coral grottos thrive. There is a single outcrop though - the tiny shallow reef snorkellers find so fascinating, just at the base of the escarpment upon which the Shirvan Road runs.

**Who made this action possible** Environment Tobago was just the coordinator. The event would not have occurred had support not been given by several members of the Tobago business community. We thank therefore Adjmal Mustapha (Tobago Motor Service/Jimmy's Holiday Resort), Jeremy Knott (Tobago Estates Agencies Limited), James Morshead (Morsheads Supermarket), Gregory Weeks of Prospect Estate, Joe and Shannon Ali-Samhoul (Joe's Lock and Key) and Kay Seetal (Mt Irvine Bay Watersports).
