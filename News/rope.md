## Unsustainability on the ropes

On the first day of the second re-opening of the beaches Environment Tobago participated in an example of Partnerships for Sustainability at the beautiful and famous Mt Irvine Bay. Admittedly it was the humblest of efforts - re-purposed rope, some concrete blocks, a few floats made out of 'rescued' containers but it was a distinct pleasure to create and install a floating rope barrier to mark the tiny (and stressed) reef there. 



What was the problem and how was it addressed by this action? We have the backstory but in case you're busy walk away knowing ET wanted to forestall shoreside accidents as well as protect the tiny reef in the bay from overfishing, improper anchoring by boats. And, still have the community feeling free to enjoy their 'seabath'.

**Mt Irvine Bay** is a unique geography. Located on the western coast it escapes the constant battering of the waves driven by the North East Trades - having to deal only with wintertime swells caused by cold fronts coming out of the North American Mainland. As a result it has accumulated over time a healthy sand layer nearer shore, over its rocky bottom. Three or four hundred meters out though coral grottos thrive. There is a single outcrop though - the tiny shallow reef snorkellers find so fascinating, just at the base of the escarpment upon which the Shirvan Road runs.    

 



The event would not have been possible had support not been given by several members of the Tobago business community.
