**Getting to understand and know more about the github program.** 
It seems quite useful and very collaboritive

I see benefits which allow me to work offline or remotely without having the constant bombardment or distraction from internet platforms. 

**It also allows me to write in plain text** quite cute

I am very much impressed by the fact that there is capacity for accessing several saved versions of one document.
