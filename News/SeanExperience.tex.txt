# My first day in markdown 

**Getting to understand and know more about the github program. 
It seems quite useful and very collaboritve**

**I see benefits which allow me to work offline or remotely without having the constant bombardment or distraction from internet platforms** 

**It also allows me to write in plain text**

**I am very much impressed by the fact that there is capacity for accessing several saved versions of one document**
