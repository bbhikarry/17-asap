<h1 id="its-that-time">Its that time</h1>
<p>We’ve been under coronvirus manners since April and what would have been The Big Upset is now just a new norm, how sexy is 2020? The problem though, aside from the immediate pain is the longterm damage to the Sustainable Development Goals agenda; Transforming Our World. Remember that? As we speak the world’s biggest nations are under duress to maintain buoyant economies, growth nothing but a mirage. The smaller countries are not doing well to understate a raft of common problems. On top of which the shift to warmer climactic conditions is accelerating but not predictably. The situation overall, awful and factual as it stands does not bode well for the SDG Agenda. which was everyone’s priority just a short time ago at December 2019.</p>
<p>We may as individuals feel and even take up our privilege to seek succour for just ourselves and nothing is really wrong with that. But at the country or administrative level, where the - any governments’ mandate is to maintain and or provide framework, the luxury of second-guessing the sustainable can not be an option So where is Trinidad and Tobago at this point nudging November 2020 with set targets for ‘Transformation’ come 2030?</p>
