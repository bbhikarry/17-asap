## The last of the great communicators speak

The thought of writing for a non-existent readership is my constant dragon (ok so I've been taking in too many slayer movies) but I'm done with that. Recently yours truly realised that people in fact do read blogs. More so than those high brow subscription-based, pedigreed, top floor digital outpourings of 'correct' prose forced from the minds and fingers of the professional (paid) writers. So I decided to start a blog, the blog to take out all others of course. Its not this one its called <17asap.net>(https://17asap.net) Don't go there now, lemme clue you in first.

Somewhere sometime along in the corridors in which I prowl it hit me that the more people know about global warming, its child Climate Change and their evil spawn; drought, storm, habitat loss, poverty and anarchy (_there are a few more_) the better chance they, us, we, have of surviving (_in_) an environment that looks set to average 40 Celcius plus. But as usual I digress. The topic for today is Communication. Not developmental strategy not  political will, just Communication.

Not so recently, about the time of Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth the blogger community - phenoms all, were the vanguard of Climate action advocacy writers but credibility was not something they were known or given credit for. Then strange things began to happen, blog consumption skyrocketed to the point even the most outlandish utterings were considered serious even real. In other words bloggers began shaping mindsets. They were, had in fact, cultivated readership. 

The people in the serious zone, my domain as it were, sat back and pondered. The fancy prose and the cultured formatting were not having any effect on the heads that counted. Politicians weren't reading, working class Joes and Janes couldn't be bothered. And teenagers, well let's say they had other things to mind. Blog platforms in the meantime were maturing into some really solid chunks of architecture. Wordpress led the way with an easy to use interface but it wasn't all that far in front of the host of Content Management platforms which for brevity's sake I'll not mention.

Is there magic then to the blogging platform? Is there  communication algorithm hidden in the code? I doubt it.  People  at the end of the seem to really prefer Simple to Complicated. This is something that should have been apparent though. Look at the popularity of opera. Huge huh? But opera is just simple life occurrences that were put to song. A similar trend is rap. Rap (music) has achieved traction among the masses, beating the balladeers and the indie pop/pers into the dust of structured harmony. 

Do I make the point then? Thinking I did if you're still here reading this drivel on my blog.
