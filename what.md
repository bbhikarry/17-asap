### Seventeen. As Soon As Possible

This website produces community driven stories revolving around Partnerships for the Sustainable Development Goals. It may be thought of as the solutions reportage on climate action within Trinidad and Tobago. 




### Focus Areas  ###

We are interested in articles that strengthen civic voice so that it:

    -  Is more effective in holding processes of governance to account
    -  Enhances civilian involvement in policy processes
    -  Shapes public discourse by procuring and disseminating perspectives

Your piece (or series) should address one or both of the following outcomes and may include aside from words, creative expression (video links/vlogs/podcasts) if it can achieve:

    -  Stronger civic voices engaging in policy processes to hold government and institutions to account:

    -  Strengthened capacity of civic voices in contributing to:

        -  Monitoring government commitments and action

        -  Supporting the implementation of the sustainable development goals(in early 2020this is the VNR) or other international agreements (Escazu) , and related local and national policy agendas (Our legal and fiscal framework)

        -  Advocating policy priorities to government that address gender and other power imbalances, disparities and discrimination

        -  Strengthening participatory methods of engaging in regional national and local governance processes [BBNJ](https://www.un.org/bbnj/content/background)? [IPU](https://ipu.org)?

        -  Raising awareness and advocating for specific policy issues (Wise use of Trinidad and Tobago's Green Fund?)

        -  Public discourse more reflective of lesser-heard voices

So your work might want to

    -  support less heard voices to contribute to public discourse on
    development issues (women, farmers and fisherfolk?)

    -  act as voice to those less heard to enalble their access to policy spaces and/or platforms
    with the potential to amplify such and other socially and environmentally positive voices. 
    
    - Hopefully influence public discourse  (_e.g Migrants, LGBTQ, Indigenes_)

### The Not So FIne Print ###

Unfortunately we are not in a position to pay for articles but rest assured of two things. One: We do not sell or plagiarise your work - if it is used in whole or part it is referenced to you as the creator. Two: You are part of a simple but solid movement seeking to re-establish the development paradigm to one that includes Nature and the natural environment wherever found as a critical element for Trinidad and Tobago's sustainability prospects.
