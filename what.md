### Seventeen. As Soon As Possible

Community driven conversations revolving around Partnerships for the Sustainble Development Goals




### Focus Areas

We are interested in articles that strengthen civic voice so that it:

-   Is more effective in holding governance institutions to account
-   Enhances involvement in policy processes
-   Shapes public discourse

Your piece (or series) should address one or both of the following outcomes and may include aside from words, creative expression (video links/vlogs/podcasts) if it can achieve:

-   **Stronger civic voices engaging in policy processes to hold government to account:**

-   **Strengthened capacity of civic voices in contributing to**:

    -   Monitoring government commitments and action

    -   Supporting the implementation of the sustainable development goals(in early 2020this is the VNR) or other international agreements (Escazu) , and related local and national policy agendas (Our legal and fiscal framework)

    -   Advocating policy priorities to government that address gender and other power imbalances, disparities and discrimination

    -   Strengthening participatory methods of engaging in regional national and local governance processes ([BBNJ](https://www.un.org/bbnj/content/background)? [IPU](https://ipu.org)?

    -   Raising awareness and advocating for specific policy issues (Wise use of Green Fund?)

-   **Public discourse more reflective of less-heard voices**.

So your work might want to

    -   support less heard voices to contribute to public discourse on
    development issues (farmers and fisherfolk?)

    -   support less heard voices to access policy spaces and/or platforms
    with the potential to amplify such and other socially and environmentally positive voices. Hopefully influence public discourse.

    ### The Not So FIne Print

    Unfortunately we are not in a position to pay for articles but rest assured of two things. One: We do not sell or plagiarise your work - if it is used in whole or part it is referenced to you as the creator. Two: You are part of a simple but solid movement seeking to re-establish the development paradigm to one that includes the natural environment as a critical element in Trinidad and Tobago.
