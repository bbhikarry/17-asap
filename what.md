### Focus Areas

We are interested in articles that strengthen civic voice so that it:

-   Is more effective in holding governance institutions to account
-   Enhances involvement in policy processes
-   Shapes public discourse

Your piece (or series) should address one or both of the following
outcomes and may include aside from words, creative expression (video
links/vlogs/podcasts) if it can achieve:

**1. Stronger civic voices engaging in policy processes to hold
government to account:**

strengthened capacity of civic voices in contributing to:

-   Monitoring government commitments and action
-   Supporting the implementation of the sustainable development
    goals(in early 2020this is the VNR) or other international
    agreements (Escazu) , and related local and national policy agendas
    (Our legal and fiscal framework)
-   Advocating policy priorities to government that address gender and
    other power imbalances, disparities and discrimination
-   Strengthening participatory methods of engaging in regional national
    and local governance processes (BBNJ? IPU?)
-   Raising awareness and advocating for specific policy issues (Use of
    Green Fund?)

**2. Public discourse more reflective of less-heard voices.** So you
piece might want to

-   support less heard voices to contribute to public discourse on
    development issues (farmers and fisherfolk?)
-   support less heard voices to access policy spaces and/or platforms
    with the potential to amplify voices and influence public discourse
    (Migrants?)
