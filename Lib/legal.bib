% \newglossaryentry{set}
% {
% name={set},
% description={a collection of objects}
% }

% 2. Define the symbol ∅ with the label emptyset:
% \newglossaryentry{emptyset}
%{
% name={\ensuremath{\emptyset}},
% description={the empty set}
% }

% (This will also need a sort key if you use Options 1 or 3, see below.)
% 3. Define the phrase “Fish Age” with the label fishage:
% \longnewglossaryentry{fishage}
% {name={Fish Age}}
%   {%
%  A common name for the Devonian geologic period
%   spanning from the end of the Silurian Period to
%    the beginning of the Carboniferous Period.
%   This age was known for its remarkable variety of
%    fish species.
%    }
% (The percent character discards the end of line character that would otherwise
%   cause an unwanted space to appear at the start of the description.)
