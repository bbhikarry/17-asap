\longnewglossaryentry{controlling-variable}
{name={Controlling variable}}
{%
A variable that is underlying or shaping change within a system. For example, CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is a controlling variable  for climate and ocean acidification. A controlling varible may not be of interest or concern in its own right but because other variables of concern are affected by it. A controlling variable may change in a slow, predictable way (e.g rising groundwater table) but the impacts of that change may not be smooth and may exhibit threshold effects. For example once saline groundwater rises to within a certain distance of the soil surface, capilliary action draws it to the surface, creating saline topsoil that can prevail even if the groundwater table falls again. In this case the controlling variable (groundwater level) changes smoothly but the rapid shift in soil salinity amounts to a rapid, effectively irreversible shock to land use options.  }

Each domain has a different set of functions, structure, feedbacks and identity. Domains are separated by thresholds that mark a critical change in feedbacks, and once a threshold is crossed the feedbacks work to keep the system in the alternate domain.   }

\newglossaryentry{feedback-loop}

name={Feedback loop}

It includes not only laws and regulations but also negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, elections, public consultations, protests, markets, online platforms for peer-to-per exchange (e.g. Airbnb) and other decision-making processes. Governance can be formally insitutionalised or, equally important "expressed through the sublte norms of interaction or even more indirectly by influencing the agendas and shaping the contexts in which actors contest decisions and determine access to resources". (Krievens et al., 2015). }
}

\newglossaryentry{system-identity}
{
name={System Identity}
description={System identity is characterised by the system structure, feedbacks and function. For a system to retain its identity in the face of a disturbance it means that the system reorganises to keep  performing in the same way (Walker and Salt, 2012).  }

{name={Intervention}}
{%
Is the term used to describe any action that is planned or made in the system. It is used specifically in a sequence of other actions such that a pathway is formed.

Interventions can be at any part of the SES such as governance, changes in rules, laws, etc.; changes in required or recommended mangement practices; capacity building including education and information flows; development of social networks, institutions, support groups; economic/finacial, financial aid; incentives and disincentives.   }
