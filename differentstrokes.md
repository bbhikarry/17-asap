The other (and equally critical) hope behind each article is; material provided here will foster a nurturing   environment for partnerships. Which, aside from the obvious benefits to those directly involved, will also embellish [SDG Goal 17](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17).

**Why is this timely**?\
Trinidad and Tobago  is now at a place where editorial independence should be jealousy guarded. In traditional  or circulation-focussed publications advertiser and investor input can in some instances influence content. 17ASAP, unlike many of those entrenched publishing platforms have opted for a neutral stance, accepting it is risky as a business model. 

**Then again, a lot is changing in our world**. \     
We  believe therefore,  as the country pursues economic growth and social progress,  the quality of development going foward should embrace a path that does not result in reduced  quality of life to future generations. In short, Development should be informed by democratically crafted government policy and by concern for the natural environment.
With this in mind we seek to provide credible and factual information, aligning it via comparison, feedback and suggestion to the  Sustainable Development Goals. 

**Equally and importantly** \
We intend to facilitate development partnerships by showcasing current best practice and works, enriching community building as it ensues. If it works even in part, Trinidad and Tobago may yet face Agenda 2030 with a smiling face. Our model therefore is a deep dive into Open Journalism. 

**A call to readers** \
We ask that you consider financial support for this work, which whether you give or not shall not impact anyone's access to this platform's content at anytime - ever. But the fact is, a few dollars will go a long way to ensure impartiality in our reporting and  maintain as well, accurate information flow. 

_A closed note to 17ASAP_\
_I only wrote this to fill a post in Workplace. In the spirit of democratising the operations of this platform, its sentiments are yet to be discussed and or approved by us_
