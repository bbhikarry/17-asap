# The 17asap idea

17 As Soon as Possible is a journal of Trinidad and Tobago's walk to achieve Agenda 2030 of the Sustainable Development Goals. It documents historical achievements i.e things put in place or 'simply' narratives introduced. This space also maps from its date of publication (May 2019) local developmental efforts attempting to incorporate sustainability[^1].

[^1]: The term Sustainability encompasses the notion that the planet and its people must endure in perpetuity while maintaining health, prosperity and well-being. This is translated into the three inter-dependent 'pillars' of sustainability i.e. environmental, social and economic health.
